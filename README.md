# ecoBantu Solutions (Pty) Ltd Website

## Background

This is the official website for ecoBantu Solutions (Pty) Ltd which is a BBBEE Level 1 Solar energy retailer, distributor and installer. This website serves for marketing purposes until the company feels that the time is ripe for an eCommerce solution to serve as a replacement and upgrade to this project.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- Next.js
- Axios
- ReactHookForm
- react-multi-carousel
- react-scroll-parallax
- theme-ui

I saw no need for the type-safety provided by TypeScript since this a basic landing page project with no substantial reliance on data from external APIs.
